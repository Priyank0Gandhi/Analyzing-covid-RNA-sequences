# Analyzing-covid-RNA-sequences

In this endeavor, we will retrieve and examine the RNA sequence data of COVID's prominent strains, Delta and Omicron. 
RNA, a nucleic acid found within every living cell, comprises a single strand composed of diverse arrangements of four nucleotides: uracil, cytosine, adenine, and guanine. 
This RNA serves as the fundamental blueprint for COVID, facilitating cellular entry and self-replication of the virus.
